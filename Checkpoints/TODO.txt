This folder is to be completed once all previous tasks are done.
The checkpoints will act as fail safes for any attendee that is unable to keep up/messed up at some point in the
workshop. They will provide all the attendee needs in order to proceed with the next phase of the workshop.


Following the word document inside res://docs:
    For each nested folder, ADD:
        All pertinent completed script and scenes for the corresponding section of the document
